## function: `get_engine() -> UnknownType`

Get or create the database engine.

Args:
    None

Returns:
    Engine: The SQLAlchemy engine instance used to connect to the database.

Notes:
    1. Create the engine only when first accessed to avoid premature connection.

    sessionmaker: The SQLAlchemy sessionmaker instance used to create database sessions.

Notes:
    1. Create the sessionmaker only when first accessed to avoid premature configuration.
    2. Reuse the same sessionmaker instance on subsequent calls to ensure consistent session behavior.
    3. No network access in this function itself; it uses the previously created engine.

---

## function: `get_db() -> Generator[Session, None, None]`

Dependency to provide database sessions to route handlers.

Args:
    None

Returns:
    Generator[Session, None, None]: A generator that yields a database session for use in route handlers.
